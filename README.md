# Spotify Data Analysis

In this project, we are going to scrape data from Spotify and analyze some of Spotify's top rock playlists. The dataset contains basic information about the songs in the playlist including the title, artist, album, and release date. In addition to that the dataset includes information about the various audio features of every song such as tempo, acousticness, and key. We are going to explore the relationships between these audio feautures.
